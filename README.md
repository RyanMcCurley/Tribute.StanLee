Hello! 

This is a tribute page to the late-great Stan Lee! This is one of my first coding projects that I've completed using only HTML and CSS. 
This is a very simple page, but I tried to incorporate some of the more intermediate CSS attributes such as usinging CSS Grid, and subclasses such as :hover
